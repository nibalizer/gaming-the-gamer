### Gaming the Gamer

This repository uses IBM Data Science Experience, sc2reader, and a game from WCS Austin 2017.


Most of the code is in 'notebook.txt' but this is a rough cut of what we'll show. More to come.


Tips:

Use the ggtracker fork of sc2reader: https://github.com/ggtracker/sc2reader/

Youtube link to the game we analyzed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpPCpChSvpg

Replay files: https://wcs.starcraft2.com/en-us/news/20719814/WCS-Austin-2017-Replays-Available!/

Look for "Grand Finals" and "Cactus Valley"
